# PasswordManager
Password Manager is a application able to add, modify and delete locally saved accounts, characterized by a software, a username and an encrypted password.  
Two languages are available: English and Italian.


The data files will be saved under "user.home / AppData / Local / Password Manager" if on Windows and on execution directory if on other operating systems.  
The software is also capable of exporting to a passwords.html or passwords.csv file, saved on the desktop.


Note: html and csv files, which are not encrypted, are extremely vulnerable.
The program will be protected with a password that the user must remember.
